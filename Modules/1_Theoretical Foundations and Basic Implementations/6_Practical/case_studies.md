## Case Study 1: Detecting DDoS Attacks with Packet Analysis

**Context** : Cybersecurity teams use packet analysis to identify Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where hackers flood servers with traffic to crash them.

**Description** :

- **Scenario** : In 2023, a major bank faced a DDoS attack targeting its online services. Analysts used Wireshark to capture packets and noticed a spike in UDP packets from multiple IP addresses to a single server port.
- **How Packet Analysis Helped** : By filtering for `udp` in Wireshark (Notebook Section 2.3), they identified abnormal traffic patterns. Statistical analysis showed a 100x increase in packets per second, confirming the attack.
- **Tools Used** : Wireshark, tcpdump.
- **Outcome** : The bank blocked malicious IPs and rerouted traffic, restoring services within hours.
- **Research Insight** : Packet analysis can use machine learning to predict attacks (Notebook Section 5). For example, analyzing the CIC-IDS2017 dataset (Notebook Mini Project) could train models to detect anomalies.
- **Link to Tutorial** : See Section 2 for capturing and analyzing packets, and Section 5 for integrating with datasets like CIC-IDS2017.
- **Scientific Question** : Can AI improve real-time DDoS detection by analyzing packet patterns?

  **Source** : Inspired by real-world cybersecurity reports, e.g., ExtraHop RevealX for AI-driven analysis (2025).

## Case Study 2: Implementing a Custom Protocol for IoT Devices

**Context** : Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like smart thermostats, need lightweight protocols to save power.

**Description** :

- **Scenario** : In 2024, a startup developed a custom protocol for smart home sensors, inspired by MQTT but optimized for low-bandwidth networks.
- **How Protocol Implementation Helped** : Engineers used Python’s `socket` library (Notebook Section 3.2, `protocol_implementation.py`) to create a protocol with a minimal header (4 bytes: 2 for magic number, 1 for length, 1 for type). This reduced overhead compared to MQTT’s 14-byte minimum.
- **Tools Used** : Python, Scapy for testing packet structure.
- **Outcome** : The protocol cut power use by 20%, enabling longer battery life for sensors.
- **Research Insight** : Custom protocols can be tested in simulated networks (Notebook Section 4) to optimize for specific use cases, like rural IoT deployments.
- **Link to Tutorial** : See Section 3 for coding protocols and Section 4 for simulating IoT networks.
- **Scientific Question** : How can protocol headers be optimized for 6G networks with ultra-low latency?

  **Source** : Based on IoT protocol trends, e.g., MQTT enhancements (PMC articles, 2025).

## Case Study 3: Simulating SDN for Enterprise Networks

**Context** : Software-Defined Networking (SDN) allows dynamic network management, used by companies like Google.

**Description** :

- **Scenario** : Google implemented SDN in its data centers to manage massive traffic (2023 case from MoldStud). Mininet was used to simulate the network before deployment.
- **How Simulation Helped** : Engineers created a virtual topology with Mininet (Notebook Section 4.2, `network_simulation.py`), testing OpenFlow controllers to optimize routing. They simulated congestion (e.g., 1 Mbps bottlenecks) and validated load balancing.
- **Tools Used** : Mininet, OpenFlow, Wireshark for packet analysis.
- **Outcome** : SDN reduced costs by 30% through efficient resource use.
- **Research Insight** : Simulations can model edge computing for 6G (Notebook Section 6), testing latency for autonomous vehicles.
- **Link to Tutorial** : See Section 4 for Mininet setup and Section 5 for SDN projects.
- **Scientific Question** : Can SDN simulations predict performance for AI-driven networks?

  **Source** : MoldStud case on SDN deployments (2025).

## Case Study 4: Quantum Networking Simulation

**Context** : Quantum networks promise ultra-secure communication using quantum entanglement.

**Description** :

- **Scenario** : In 2025, Aliro Quantum deployed a testbed for quantum key distribution (QKD). Researchers used NS-3 to simulate quantum-classical hybrid networks.
- **How Simulation Helped** : NS-3 modeled classical packet flows alongside simulated quantum channels (Notebook Section 4.2). Packet analysis verified QKD headers.
- **Tools Used** : NS-3, custom quantum simulation libraries.
- **Outcome** : Proved feasibility of hybrid networks for secure banking transactions.
- **Research Insight** : Quantum protocols may disrupt encryption (Notebook Section 5). Simulations can explore scalability challenges.
- **Link to Tutorial** : See Section 4 for NS-3 and Section 6 for quantum research directions.
- **Scientific Question** : How can simulations bridge classical and quantum protocol inefficiencies?

  **Source** : Aliro Quantum testbed reports (2025).
