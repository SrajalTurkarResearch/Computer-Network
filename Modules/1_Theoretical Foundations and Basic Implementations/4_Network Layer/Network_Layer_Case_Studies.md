## Case Study 1: The 2021 Facebook Outage – Routing Protocol Failure

**Context** : On October 4, 2021, Facebook (including WhatsApp and Instagram) experienced a global outage lasting over six hours, affecting billions of users.

**Network Layer Relevance** :

- **Routing (BGP)** : The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** , a distance-vector-like routing protocol used to connect autonomous systems (e.g., ISPs, tech companies). BGP withdrew routes to Facebook’s servers, making them unreachable.
- **Forwarding** : Routers worldwide updated their forwarding tables, effectively removing paths to Facebook’s IP prefixes (e.g., 157.240.0.0/16).
- **IP Addressing** : The outage exposed vulnerabilities in IP-based routing, as spoofed or erroneous BGP announcements could disrupt global connectivity.

  **Details** :

- A routine maintenance update introduced a bug in BGP configurations, causing Facebook’s DNS servers to become unreachable.
- Forwarding tables globally dropped routes to Facebook’s IPs, halting all traffic.
- Recovery required manual reconfiguration, delayed by physical access issues to data centers.

  **Lessons Learned** :

- **Decentralized Routing Vulnerabilities** : BGP’s trust-based model allows misconfigurations to propagate globally, similar to Bellman-Ford’s count-to-infinity issue.
- **Research Opportunity** : Develop AI-driven BGP anomaly detection to prevent outages.
- **Scientific Insight** : Resilience in distributed systems is critical for research networks (e.g., sharing large datasets).

  **Relevance to You** : As a scientist, studying BGP failures can inspire protocols for fault-tolerant networks, such as those for space exploration or global climate monitoring.

## Case Study 2: IPv6 Adoption in the United States – Addressing the Future

**Context** : By 2025, IPv6 adoption in the US reached 43%, driven by IoT growth and IPv4 address exhaustion.

**Network Layer Relevance** :

- **IP Addressing** : IPv4’s 4.3 billion addresses were depleted by 2011, necessitating IPv6’s 340 undecillion addresses to support IoT devices (e.g., smart homes, sensors).
- **Forwarding** : IPv6’s simplified header (40 bytes, no fragmentation) improves forwarding efficiency in routers.
- **Routing** : Protocols like OSPF (using Dijkstra’s) adapted for IPv6, optimizing paths in large-scale IoT networks.

  **Details** :

- Companies like Google and Comcast led IPv6 adoption, with 40% of global traffic using IPv6 by 2025.
- IoT devices (e.g., smart thermostats, medical sensors) rely on IPv6’s vast address space for unique identifiers.
- Challenges included legacy systems and transition costs, requiring NAT64 gateways for IPv4-IPv6 coexistence.

  **Lessons Learned** :

- **Scalability** : IPv6’s hierarchical addressing reduces routing table sizes, a model for future networks.
- **Research Opportunity** : Optimize IPv6 for low-power IoT devices in environmental monitoring.
- **Scientific Insight** : Address space design impacts scalability in distributed scientific experiments (e.g., global sensor arrays).

  **Relevance to You** : Understanding IPv6’s adoption challenges can guide research into addressing schemes for interplanetary networks or biological systems.

## Case Study 3: 2023 Submarine Cable Failures – Forwarding Resilience

**Context** : In 2023, multiple submarine cables in the Pacific were damaged by natural disasters, disrupting internet connectivity between Asia and North America.

**Network Layer Relevance** :

- **Forwarding** : Routers dynamically updated forwarding tables to reroute traffic via alternative paths (e.g., satellite links).
- **Routing** : BGP and OSPF recalculated paths to bypass failed links, leveraging Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths.
- **IP Addressing** : Stable IP assignments ensured packets reached correct destinations despite rerouting.

  **Details** :

- Cables like SEA-ME-WE 4 were cut, increasing latency for research institutions sharing data across continents.
- Forwarding tables adapted in real-time, directing traffic to less congested routes.
- Challenges included latency spikes and bandwidth constraints on backup paths.

  **Lessons Learned** :
