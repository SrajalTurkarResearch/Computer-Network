## 1. Introduction to Computer Networks

### What Are Computer Networks?

A **computer network** is like a big city where devices (computers, phones, routers) are buildings, and connections (wires, Wi-Fi) are roads. These devices send **data packets** (like letters) to share information, such as emails, videos, or files.

- **Key Parts** :
- **Nodes** : Devices like routers or computers (city buildings).
- **Links** : Connections like Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi (roads).
- **Protocols** : Rules for sending data, like traffic signs.
- **Types** :
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** : Small, like an office network.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** : Huge, like the Internet.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** : City-wide networks.

### Why Routing, Optimization, and Simulation Matter

- **Routing** : Finds the best path for data, like a postal service choosing the fastest delivery route. Without it, data gets lost or delayed.
- **Optimization** : Makes networks faster and more reliable, like widening roads to avoid traffic jams.
- **Simulation** : Tests network designs virtually, like planning a city in a video game before building it.
- **Example** : A company simulates a new network to ensure it handles video calls before buying routers.

### Goals of This Tutorial

You’ll learn to:

- Understand and implement routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP).
- Optimize networks for speed and reliability.
- Simulate networks to test ideas.
- Explore research ideas like AI and quantum networking.
- Build projects and solve exercises to become a network scientist.

## 2. Fundamentals of Routing Protocols

### Definition and Purpose

A **routing protocol** is a set of rules that routers use to share information and pick the best paths for data. Think of routers as post offices deciding which roads to send packages down.

- **Purpose** :
- Discover the network layout (like mapping a city).
- Choose the best paths based on metrics (e.g., speed, distance).
- Adapt to changes, like road closures.

### Types of Routing Protocols

1. **Distance Vector Protocols** (e.g., RIP, EIGRP):
   - Share their full list of paths (routing table) with nearby routers.
   - Pick paths with the fewest stops (hops).
   - **Analogy** : Asking neighbors, “How many streets to the store?”
2. **Link-State Protocols** (e.g., OSPF, IS-IS):
   - Share details about their direct connections to build a full network map.
   - Pick paths based on speed (bandwidth).
   - **Analogy** : Using a GPS with a complete city map.
3. **Path Vector Protocols** (e.g., BGP):
   - Keep a list of networks (like cities) data will cross.
   - Used for the Internet, choosing paths based on rules.
   - **Analogy** : A travel plan listing every city on a road trip.

### Key Concepts

- **Routing Table** : A list in each router showing where to send data (e.g., “To Network A, go to Router B, 2 hops”).
- **Metric** : A number to compare paths (e.g., hops for RIP, bandwidth for OSPF).
- **Convergence** : When all routers agree on the network map after a change (e.g., a broken link). Faster convergence means less delay.
- **Scalability** : How well a protocol works in big networks (OSPF scales better than RIP).

### Static vs. Dynamic Routing

- **Static Routing** : Manually set paths, like writing a fixed delivery route.
- Pros: Simple for small networks.
- Cons: Doesn’t adapt to changes.
- **Dynamic Routing** : Uses protocols (RIP, OSPF) to adapt automatically.
- Pros: Scales well, handles failures.
- Cons: More complex to set up.

### Graph Theory Basics

Networks are modeled as **graphs** :

- **Nodes** : Routers or devices.
- **Edges** : Links with weights (e.g., hops, cost based on bandwidth).
- **Example Graph** :

```
  R1 --(cost 1)-- R2 --(cost 2)-- R3
  R1 --(cost 4)-- R3
```

- **Why It Matters** : Graph theory helps calculate paths (e.g., shortest path algorithms).

---

## 3. In-Depth Routing Protocols

Let’s explore each protocol, their mechanics, and the math behind them.

### Distance Vector: RIP and EIGRP

- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** :
- Picks paths with the fewest hops (max 15).
- Shares routing tables every 30 seconds.
- Simple but slow to converge (up to 180 seconds).
- Use: Small networks like schools.
- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** :
- Cisco’s advanced version of distance vector.
- Uses a **composite metric** (bandwidth, delay, load, reliability).
- **DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm)** : Ensures loop-free paths and fast convergence.
- Use: Medium to large networks.
- **Analogy** : RIP is a driver counting turns; EIGRP checks road speed and traffic.

**Math: Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

- Finds shortest paths by asking neighbors.
- Formula:
  [
  \text{Distance}(v) = \min(\text{Distance}(u) + \text{Cost}(u,v))
  ]
  where ( u ) is a neighbor of ( v ).
- **Example** : If Router A to B is 1 hop, and B to C is 2 hops, total distance A to C is 3 hops.

### Link-State: OSPF and IS-IS

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** :
- Shares **Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)** to build a network map.
- Picks paths based on link cost (e.g., ( \frac{10^8}{\text{bandwidth}} )).
- Fast convergence (seconds), great for large networks.
- **Multi-Area OSPF** : Divides big networks into areas for efficiency.
- **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)** :
- Similar to OSPF, used by ISPs.
- Supports larger networks and IPv6 natively.
- **Analogy** : OSPF is a GPS with real-time traffic updates.

**Math: Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

- Finds shortest paths by exploring nodes with the lowest cost.
- Formula:
  [
  \text{Total Cost} = \sum \text{Cost}(edges)
  ]
- **Example** : A 100 Mbps link has cost ( \frac{10^8}{100 \times 10^6} = 1 ).

### Path Vector: BGP

- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** :
- Used for Internet routing between **Autonomous Systems (AS)** .
- Keeps a list of AS paths (e.g., “Pass through AT&T, then Verizon”).
- Uses **policies** (e.g., prefer shorter paths or trusted providers).
- **Types** :
- **eBGP** : Between different ASes.
- **iBGP** : Within one AS.
- **Attributes** : Path length, AS path, local preference.
- **Analogy** : A travel itinerary choosing trusted airlines.

### Visualization: Network Topologies

Imagine a network as a city map:

- **Nodes** : Intersections (routers).
- **Edges** : Roads with weights (hops for RIP, costs for OSPF).
- **Example** :

```
  RIP:  R1 --(1 hop)-- R2 --(1 hop)-- R3
  OSPF: R1 --(cost 10)-- R2 --(cost 5)-- R3
        R1 --(cost 2)-- R3 (faster)
```

---

## 4. Practical Implementation of Routing Protocols

Let’s set up a network in **Cisco Packet Tracer** (free for students) to configure RIP, OSPF, and BGP.

### Setting Up a Network

- **Topology** :
- 4 routers (R1, R2, R3, R4).
- 2 PCs (PC1 on R1, PC2 on R4).
- Links: R1-R2, R2-R3, R3-R4, R1-R4.
- IP Addresses:
  - R1-R2: 192.168.1.0/24 (R1: 192.168.1.1, R2: 192.168.1.2).
  - R2-R3: 192.168.2.0/24.
  - R3-R4: 192.168.3.0/24.
  - R1-R4: 192.168.4.0/24.
  - PC1: 192.168.5.2/24.
  - PC2: 192.168.6.2/24.

### Configuring RIP

**Steps** :

1. Open Packet Tracer, create the topology.
2. Assign IP addresses to router interfaces and PCs.
3. Enable RIP on each router.

**R1 Configuration** :

```bash
R1> enable
R1# configure terminal
R1(config)# router rip
R1(config-router)# version 2
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.4.0
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.5.0
```

**How It Works** : RIP shares paths every 30 seconds, choosing the fewest hops.

### Configuring OSPF

**Steps** :

1. Use the same topology.
2. Enable OSPF with process ID 1 and Area 0.

**R1 Configuration** :

```bash
R1> enable
R1# configure terminal
R1(config)# router ospf 1
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.5.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
```

**How It Works** : OSPF builds a map and uses Dijkstra to find the fastest path.

### Configuring BGP

**Steps** :

1. Simulate two ASes (AS 100: R1, R2; AS 200: R3, R4).
2. Configure BGP neighbors.

**R1 Configuration (AS 100)** :

```bash
R1> enable
R1# configure terminal
R1(config)# router bgp 100
R1(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.4.2 remote-as 200
R1(config-router)# network 192.168.5.0 mask 255.255.255.0
```

**How It Works** : BGP shares AS paths and applies policies.

### Troubleshooting

- **RIP** : Check hop limit (15) or update timers (show ip rip database).
- **OSPF** : Verify area IDs (show ip ospf neighbor).
- **BGP** : Ensure AS numbers match (show ip bgp summary).

### Example: Small Business Network

Design a network for a small business with three branches:

- **Branch A** : PC1 (192.168.5.2) on R1.
- **Branch B** : On R2.
- **Branch C** : PC2 (192.168.6.2) on R4.
- Use OSPF for fast, reliable data sharing (e.g., inventory updates).

### Advanced Example: Multi-Area OSPF

For a large company:

- **Area 0** : Backbone connecting R1-R4.
- **Area 1** : Branch A’s LAN.
- **Area 2** : Branch C’s LAN.
- **Stub Area** : Reduces routing overhead in Branch C by limiting external routes.

## 5. Network Performance Optimization

### Metrics

- **Latency** : Time for data to travel (e.g., 50 ms).
- **Throughput** : Data rate (e.g., 1 Gbps).
- **Jitter** : Delay variation (bad for video calls).
- **Packet Loss** : Percentage of lost data (e.g., 0.1%).

### Techniques

1. **Quality of Service (QoS)** :

- Prioritize critical traffic (e.g., VoIP over email).
- Example: Use DSCP to mark VoIP packets as high priority.

1. **Load Balancing** :

- Split traffic across multiple paths.
- Example: Use two links between routers.

1. **Compression** :

- Shrink data (e.g., compress video streams).

1. **Caching** :

- Store data locally (e.g., CDN for Netflix).

1. **Traffic Engineering** :

- Plan paths to avoid congestion (e.g., MPLS or SDN).

### Mathematical Models

1. **M/M/1 Queuing Model** :

- **Arrival Rate (λ)** : Packets per second.
- **Service Rate (μ)** : Packets processed per second.
- **Waiting Time** : ( W = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda} ).
- **Queue Length** : ( L = \lambda \cdot W ) (Little’s Law).
- **Example** : If ( \lambda = 100 ), ( \mu = 120 ), then ( W = \frac{1}{120 - 100} = 0.05 ) s, ( L = 100 \cdot 0.05 = 5 ) packets.

1. **Markov Chains** :

- Model network states (e.g., idle, congested).
- Transition probabilities predict performance.

1. **Linear Programming** :

- Optimize link weights for load balancing.
- Example: Minimize ( \sum \text{Link Load} ) subject to capacity constraints.

### Real-World Case: Cloud Provider Optimization

A cloud provider (like AWS) faced high latency during peak hours. They:

- Used QoS to prioritize database traffic.
- Balanced load across multiple data centers.
- Cached static content at edge locations.
- **Result** : Latency reduced from 200 ms to 30 ms.

### Visualization: Performance Graphs

Imagine a graph:

```
Throughput (Mbps)
100 |        _______
    |       /       \
 50 |      /         \
    |_____/___________\
      0    5     10  Time (s)
```

**Heatmap** : Shows congested links (red = high load, blue = low).

- **OMNeT++** : Modular, detailed simulations.
- **GNS3** : Emulates real routers.
- **Mininet** : Simulates SDN networks.
- **Riverbed Modeler** : Commercial, enterprise-grade.

### Step-by-Step: Simulating RIP, OSPF, BGP

**Scenario** : Use Packet Tracer for the 4-router topology (Section 4).

1. Configure RIP, test PC1 to PC2 ping.
2. Simulate link failure (disable R1-R4), check convergence.
3. Repeat with OSPF (faster convergence).
4. Simulate BGP with two ASes, verify neighbor adjacency.

### Advanced Simulation: Scalability and Failure

Use NS-3 to simulate a 100-node network:

1. Install NS-3 (Linux/WSL).
2. Write a script for OSPF with heavy traffic.
3. Measure latency and packet loss under failures.

**Example NS-3 Script** :

```cpp
#include "ns3/core-module.h"
#include "ns3/internet-module.h"
#include "ns3/point-to-point-module.h"
using namespace ns3;
int main() {
  NodeContainer nodes; nodes.Create(4);
  PointToPointHelper p2p;
  p2p.SetDeviceAttribute("DataRate", StringValue("5Mbps"));
  p2p.SetChannelAttribute("Delay", StringValue("2ms"));
  Simulator::Run();
  Simulator::Destroy();
  return 0;
}
```

### Visualization: Traffic Flows
