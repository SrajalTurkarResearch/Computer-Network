Tutorial File 2: Simulating RIP Routing with Hop Count
Purpose: Understand RIP (Routing Information Protocol), a distance vector protocol that picks paths with fewest hops.
This script simulates choosing the shortest path by hop count and includes a mini-project.
For aspiring scientists: Modify the paths to study convergence time.

Mini-Project: Simulate RIP convergence
1. Add a new path: ['R1', 'R5', 'R3']
2. Simulate a link failure (remove ['R1', 'R2', 'R3'])
3. Rerun rip_hop_count to see new choice

"""
RIP has slow convergence (up to 180 seconds). Experiment with:
- Adding more paths to see how RIP handles complexity.
- Compare with EIGRP (faster convergence, per 2024 studies).
- Use CAIDA dataset[](https://www.caida.org) for real-world path analysis.
