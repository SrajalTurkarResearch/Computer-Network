## 1. Foundations of Computer Networks

### 1.1 What is a Computer Network?

A computer network connects devices (phones, laptops, sensors) to share data in packets—small chunks with sender/receiver addresses and data.  **Analogy** : A classroom where students pass notes, with a teacher (router) ensuring delivery.

* **Components** :
* **Nodes** : Devices (e.g., your phone, a smart thermostat).
* **Links** : Wired (Ethernet) or wireless (radio waves).
* **Protocols** : Rules like TCP/IP. TCP ensures reliable delivery; IP routes packets.
* **Routers/Switches** : Direct packets; routers link networks (e.g., home to internet).
* **Example** : Streaming a video sends packets from a server to your TV. In research, a network shares sensor data from a telescope to a lab computer.
* **History** : ARPANET (1969) pioneered packet-switching, enabling reliable data transfer despite failures, foundational for the internet.
* **Science Connection** : Networks enable collaborative science, e.g., CERN’s Large Hadron Collider shares petabytes of particle data globally.
* **Visualization** : Sketch a circle with devices (phone, laptop) connected to a router by lines (wired) or waves (wireless). Label packets with arrows.
* **Exercise** : List 5 devices in your home network. Trace a packet’s path from your phone to Google (phone → router → ISP → server).
* **Notebook Tip** : Write: “Networks connect devices via packets, guided by TCP/IP.” Draw the topology sketch.

### 1.2 Types of Networks

* **LAN (Local Area Network)** : Small, like home Wi-Fi (~100 m range).
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)** : Large, like the internet or cellular networks.
* **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** : City-wide, like campus Wi-Fi.
* **PAN (Personal Area Network)** : Personal devices, like Bluetooth earbuds.
* **Wireless Networks** : Use radio waves for mobility.
* **Example** : A hospital LAN connects heart monitors; a WAN shares data with remote doctors. In science, a PAN links lab sensors to a tablet.
* **Visualization** : Draw a small LAN circle (router + devices) inside a larger WAN circle (internet). Add wavy lines for wireless signals.
* **Exercise** : Identify your home LAN devices. Are they wired or wireless? Imagine scaling to a WAN for global research collaboration.
* **Notebook Tip** : Write: “LAN = local, WAN = global, wireless = no cables.” Sketch LAN/WAN circles with examples.

### 1.3 OSI Model: The Network Blueprint

The OSI model is a 7-layer framework for data transfer, like a recipe for sending packets. Wireless focuses on Layers 1–2:

* **Layer 1 (Physical)** : Transmits raw bits (0s and 1s) via wires or radio waves.
* **Layer 2 (Data Link)** : Groups bits into frames, adds MAC addresses (device IDs), and manages access (e.g., who sends when).
* **Layers 3–7** : Handle routing (Network), reliability (Transport), and apps (Session, Presentation, Application).
* **Analogy** : Making a cake: Layer 1 gathers ingredients (bits), Layer 2 mixes batter (frames), higher layers bake and serve.
* **Example** : In a video call, Layer 1 sends audio bits over Wi-Fi, Layer 2 ensures devices take turns, Layer 7 displays video. In research, Layer 1 transmits sensor bits from a weather station.
* **Math (Shannon’s Capacity)** : Maximum data rate C = B * log₂(1 + SNR).
* **Derivation** : From information theory, log₂(1 + SNR) gives bits per symbol based on signal clarity; B scales it by available frequency.
* **Open Calculation** : B = 20 MHz = 20e6 Hz, SNR = 15 (signal 15x stronger than noise).
  * Step 1: 1 + SNR = 1 + 15 = 16.
  * Step 2: log₂(16) = 4 (since 2⁴ = 16).
  * Step 3: C = 20e6 * 4 = 80e6 bits/s = 80 Mbps.
  *  **Edge Case** : If SNR = 3 (noisy), log₂(4) = 2, C = 40 Mbps—noise halves rate.
* **Python** : Run `shannon_capacity.py` to compute C for B = 40 MHz, SNR = 31 (expect ~200 Mbps).
* **Visualization** : Draw a 7-layer stack (Physical at bottom, Application at top). Highlight Layers 1–2. Add arrows for data flow (bits → frames → app).
* **Science Connection** : Optimize Layer 1 for noisy environments (e.g., underwater sensors). Simulate SNR effects in Python.
* **Exercise** : Calculate C for B = 40 MHz, SNR = 7.
* Solution: 1 + 7 = 8, log₂(8) = 3, C = 40e6 * 3 = 120 Mbps.
* **Notebook Tip** : Write: “OSI: 7 layers; wireless uses 1–2. C = B * log₂(1 + SNR).” Draw stack, work through math.

## 2. Wireless Network Physics

### 2.1 Radio Wave Propagation

Wireless networks use radio waves (3 kHz–300 GHz) sent via antennas. Common bands:

* **2.4 GHz** : Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, long range, crowded.
* **5 GHz** : Wi-Fi, faster, less penetration.
* **mmWave (24–100 GHz)** : 5G, ultra-fast, short range.
* **Analogy** : Shouting across a playground—trees (walls) block, others shouting (interference) disrupt.
* **Challenges** :
* **Path Loss** : Signal weakens with distance (1/d²).
* **Shadowing** : Obstacles (walls) block signals.
* **Multipath Fading** : Bounced signals interfere, causing nulls.
* **Interference** : Overlapping signals from other devices.
* **Math (Friis Equation)** : Pr = Pt * Gt * Gr * (λ / (4πd))².
* **Derivation** : Power spreads spherically (1/d²); λ = c/f accounts for frequency-dependent loss; Gt/Gr amplify directionally.
* **Open Calculation** : Pt = 0.1 W, Gt = Gr = 2, f = 2.4 GHz, d = 100 m.
  * Step 1: λ = c / f = 3e8 / 2.4e9 = 0.125 m.
  * Step 2: 4πd = 4 * 3.14 * 100 ≈ 1256.
  * Step 3: λ / (4πd) = 0.125 / 1256 ≈ 0.0000995.
  * Step 4: (λ / (4πd))² ≈ 9.9e-9.
  * Step 5: Pr = 0.1 * 2 * 2 * 9.9e-9 ≈ 4e-9 W (-54 dBm, weak signal).
  *  **Edge Case** : At d = 200 m, (1/d²) quarters Pr to ~1e-9 W; add noise floor (-90 dBm) to assess detectability.
* **Python** : Run `friis_path_loss.py` to plot Pr vs. d.
* **Example** : Your 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi drops in a basement due to shadowing; 5 GHz struggles with walls; mmWave fails outside a room.
* **Visualization** : Sketch two antennas: straight line (direct path), wavy lines (bounced paths). Mark fading nulls where signals cancel.
* **Exercise** : Calculate Pr for f = 5 GHz (λ = 0.06 m), d = 50 m, Pt = 0.1 W, Gt = Gr = 1.5.
* Solution: Pr ≈ 1.35e-8 W (-48.7 dBm).
* **Notebook Tip** : Write: “Radio waves face path loss, fading, interference. Friis: Pr = Pt * Gt * Gr * (λ / (4πd))².” Draw propagation sketch, run Python.

### 2.2 Modulation: Encoding Data on Waves

Modulation maps bits to radio waves by changing amplitude, frequency, or phase:

* **ASK** : Vary amplitude (high = 1, low = 0).
* **FSK** : Vary frequency (high = 1, low = 0).
* **QAM** : Combine amplitude/phase (e.g., 64-QAM = 64 symbols).
* **OFDM** : Split channel into subcarriers for robustness.
* **Analogy** : Writing a message by flashing a light—brightness (ASK), speed (FSK), or pattern (QAM).
* **Math** : QAM efficiency η = log₂(M), where M = number of symbols.
* **Derivation** : Each symbol encodes a unique bit combination; M = 2^η.
* **Open Calculation** : 64-QAM (M = 64).
  * Step 1: Find power of 2: 2⁶ = 64.
  * Step 2: η = log₂(64) = 6 bits/symbol.
  *  **Edge Case** : 256-QAM needs SNR > 20 to avoid errors (log₂(256) = 8).
* **Full Rate** : Rate = B * η * N * R (B = bandwidth, N = MIMO antennas, R = coding rate).
* **Open Calculation** : B = 20 MHz, 16-QAM (η = log₂(16) = 4), N = 2, R = 0.75.
  * Step 1: B * η = 20e6 * 4 = 80e6 bits/s.
  * Step 2: * N = 80e6 * 2 = 160e6 bits/s.
  * Step 3: * R = 160e6 * 0.75 = 120e6 bits/s = 120 Mbps.
* **Example** : OFDM in Wi-Fi 6 streams video through walls; QAM in 5G boosts speed for VR.
* **Python** : Modify `shannon_capacity.py` to include η (e.g., η = log₂(64) = 6).
* **Visualization** : Sketch a sine wave with varying heights (ASK), frequencies (FSK), or a grid of 64 points (64-QAM).
* **Exercise** : Calculate rate for B = 40 MHz, 64-QAM, N = 1, R = 5/6 (expect ~200 Mbps).
* **Notebook Tip** : Write: “Modulation: ASK, FSK, QAM, OFDM. Rate = B * log₂(M) * N * R.” Draw QAM grid, work through math.

### 2.3 Antennas and MIMO

Antennas convert signals to/from radio waves. **MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)** uses multiple antennas for parallel streams or better reliability.

* **Analogy** : Multiple megaphones shouting different messages (streams) or one loud message (reliability).
* **Math** : Rate = B * log₂(1 + SNR) * min(Nt, Nr).
* **Derivation** : min(Nt, Nr) limits streams to available antenna pairs; Shannon scales per stream.
* **Open Calculation** : B = 100 MHz, SNR = 100, Nt = 64, Nr = 4.
  * Step 1: log₂(1 + 100) ≈ 6.66.
  * Step 2: B * log = 100e6 * 6.66 ≈ 666e6 bits/s.
  * Step 3: min(64, 4) = 4.
  * Step 4: Rate = 666e6 * 4 ≈ 2.66 Gbps.
  *  **Edge Case** : If Nt = 2, min(2, 4) = 2, rate halves to 1.33 Gbps.
* **Example** : Wi-Fi 6 router with 4 antennas streams to multiple devices; 5G Massive MIMO (64 antennas) serves a stadium.
* **Python** : Run `mimo_throughput.py` for Nt = 8, Nr = 8.
* **Visualization** : Draw a router with 4 antennas, each arrow to a device (phone, laptop).
* **Exercise** : Calculate MIMO rate for B = 200 MHz, SNR = 15, Nt = 128, Nr = 8 (expect ~6.54 Gbps).
* **Notebook Tip** : Write: “MIMO: Rate = Shannon * min(Nt, Nr).” Draw MIMO sketch, run Python.

### 2.4 Security in Wireless

Radio waves are public, so encryption (e.g., WPA3) and passwords protect data.

* **Example** : WPA3 prevents KRACK attacks (WPA2 flaw, 2017). In research, secure IoT sensors in a forest.
* **Math** : Brute-force security: For 8-char password (62 chars), tries = 62⁸ ≈ 2.18e14.
* **Science Connection** : Research lightweight encryption for low-power devices (e.g., AES with 128-bit keys).
* **Exercise** : Estimate tries for a 10-char password (62¹⁰ ≈ 8.4e17).
* **Notebook Tip** : Write: “WPA3 encrypts data; passwords block intruders.” Note security math.

### 2.5 Missing in Standard Tutorials

* **Derivations** : Friis’s 1/d² from spherical wave spreading (power = P/(4πd²)).
* **Wi-Fi Sensing** : Use Channel State Information (CSI) for motion detection (e.g., heart rate via signal reflections).
* **Stochastic Geometry** : Model base station coverage: P(coverage) = exp(-λ π r²).
* **Open Calculation** : λ = 0.0001/km², r = 100 m → exp(-0.0001 * π * 10000) ≈ 0.73.
* **Research Prompt** : Simulate Wi-Fi sensing in Python (model Doppler shifts).

### 3.3 Factors Affecting Wi-Fi Performance

* **Channels** : 2.4 GHz (3 non-overlapping: 1, 6, 11), 5 GHz (24+), 6 GHz (more). Overlap causes interference.
* **Improvements** : Wider channels (80/160 MHz), DFS (avoid radar).
* **Math** : Same rate formula as above. Interference reduces effective SNR.
* **Example** : Crowded 2.4 GHz channel 1 slows Wi-Fi; 5 GHz channel 36 is clearer.

## 4. Channel Access Models

### 4.1 Need for Access Control

Devices share the same frequency, risking collisions.  **Analogy** : Students talking in class—rules prevent chaos.

* **Problems** :
* **Hidden Terminal** : A and B can’t hear each other but collide at C.
* **Exposed Terminal** : A avoids sending due to C, wasting time.
* **Example** : In a café, laptops collide on Wi-Fi, freezing calls. In IoT, collisions lose sensor data.
* **Visualization** : Draw A–C–B (hidden terminal, no A–B link).
* **Notebook Tip** : Write: “Collisions need rules; hidden/exposed terminals disrupt.” Draw scenario.

### 4.2 CSMA/CA: Wi-Fi’s Sharing Rule

* **Steps** : Listen (DIFS ~50 μs), backoff (random 0–CW slots), optional RTS/CTS, send, ACK.
* **Math** : Collision prob p ≈ 1/(CW+1); throughput η ≈ T_data / (T_data + T_backoff + T_collision).
* **Derivation** : p from uniform backoff distribution; η accounts for delays.
* **Open Calculation** : CW = 15, n = 10, T_data = 1500 bytes / 54 Mbps = 222 μs, slot = 20 μs, DIFS = 50 μs.
  * Step 1: p = 1/(15+1) = 0.0625.
  * Step 2: Effective p = 1 - (1-0.0625)¹⁰ ≈ 0.47.
  * Step 3: T_backoff = (CW/2) * 20 = 7.5 * 20 = 150 μs.
  * Step 4: η = 222 / (222 + 150 + 50) ≈ 0.53 → 54 * 0.53 ≈ 28.6 Mbps.
  *  **Edge Case** : CW = 31 reduces p but increases T_backoff, balancing η.
* **Python** : Run `csma_ca_collision.py` for n = 20.
* **Example** : Wi-Fi 6 OFDMA reduces collisions (see Case Study 3).
* **Visualization** : Draw flowchart: Listen → Backoff → Send → ACK.
* **Exercise** : Calculate η for CW = 31, n = 5 (lower p, higher η).
