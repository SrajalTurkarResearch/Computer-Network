# Case Study: IoT and Edge Computing in Real-World Applications

## Introduction

This case study explores three real-world applications of IoT and edge computing—Smart Agriculture, Autonomous Vehicles, and Smart Cities—to illustrate scalability and latency models in computer networks. As an aspiring scientist, you’ll see how these systems work, why they matter, and how they connect to the theories in the tutorial (e.g., queuing models, Amdahl’s Law). Each case highlights how edge computing reduces latency and how IoT networks scale, with challenges and research opportunities to fuel your career.

## 1. Smart Agriculture: Optimizing Irrigation with IoT and Edge

### Overview

In smart agriculture, companies like John Deere use IoT sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and crop health across vast farms. Edge computing processes this data locally to make instant irrigation decisions, saving 20-30% water and boosting yields (IEEE Journals, 2025).

### Implementation

- **IoT Setup**: Thousands of sensors (e.g., soil moisture probes) are deployed across a farm. Each sensor sends small data packets (e.g., 4 KB) every minute via low-power protocols like Zigbee or NB-IoT.
- **Edge Computing**: Local edge nodes (e.g., Raspberry Pi-based gateways) analyze sensor data to decide when to activate sprinklers, reducing reliance on distant cloud servers.
- **Network**: A hybrid topology (star for sensors to edge, mesh for edge nodes) ensures scalability.

### Scalability Analysis

- **Challenge**: Farms may scale from 100 to 10,000 sensors. Network load grows linearly: Load = Sensors × Data Rate (e.g., 500 bits/s per sensor).
- **Example**: For 1,000 sensors, load = 1,000 × 500 / 1e6 = 0.5 Mbps. For 10,000, load = 5 Mbps, manageable with 5G or LoRaWAN.
- **Model**: Use horizontal scalability by adding edge nodes. Amdahl’s Law suggests parallel processing limits speedup, so distribute tasks across nodes.

### Latency Analysis

- **Edge Advantage**: Local processing (1 km distance) yields latency ~0.55 ms (Propagation: 1/200 = 0.005 ms, Transmission: 4,000/10e6 × 1,000 = 0.4 ms, Queue: 0.1 ms, Processing: 0.05 ms).
- **Cloud Comparison**: Cloud at 1,000 km yields ~5.55 ms (Propagation: 1,000/200 = 5 ms).
- **Impact**: Edge reduces latency by ~90%, critical for real-time irrigation to prevent crop loss.

### Challenges

- **Interoperability**: Sensors from different vendors use varied protocols. Solution: Standardize with 6LoWPAN.
- **Energy**: Battery-powered sensors need low-power protocols like NB-IoT.
- **Security**: Edge nodes are vulnerable to physical tampering. Research blockchain-based authentication.

### Research Opportunities

- Simulate large-scale farms (10,000+ sensors) using NS-3 to test scalability limits.
- Develop AI models at edge for predictive irrigation, minimizing water use.
- Explore energy harvesting (e.g., solar-powered sensors) for sustainability.

## 2. Autonomous Vehicles: Real-Time Decisions with Edge Computing

### Overview

Autonomous vehicles, like Tesla’s, rely on edge computing to process sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, cameras) for instant decisions like braking, achieving <10 ms latency (Automotive Reports, 2025).

### Implementation

- **IoT Setup**: A vehicle has 10-20 sensors (e.g., cameras sending 10 KB packets) connected via an internal bus (CAN or Ethernet).
- **Edge Computing**: On-board GPUs process data locally, avoiding cloud delays.
- **Network**: 5G connects vehicles to infrastructure for updates, but edge handles real-time tasks.

### Scalability Analysis

- **Challenge**: A fleet of 1 million vehicles, each with 20 sensors, generates massive data (1 GB/min per vehicle).
- **Model**: Horizontal scalability via edge nodes per vehicle. Network load = Vehicles × Sensors × Data Rate. For 1,000 vehicles, 20 sensors, 8,000 bits/s: Load = 1,000 × 20 × 8,000 / 1e6 = 160 Mbps.
- **Solution**: Distribute processing to vehicle edges, reducing central network strain.

### Latency Analysis

- **Edge Advantage**: On-board processing (0 km) yields latency ~0.85 ms (Propagation: 0, Transmission: 80,000/100e6 × 1,000 = 0.8 ms, Queue: 0.03 ms, Processing: 0.02 ms).
- **Cloud Comparison**: Cloud at 500 km yields ~3.35 ms (Propagation: 500/200 = 2.5 ms).
- **Impact**: Edge meets <10 ms requirement for safety-critical braking.

### Challenges

- **Data Volume**: High data rates strain 5G. Solution: Compress data or prioritize critical packets.
- **Security**: Edge nodes need fast encryption. Research lightweight cryptography.
- **Reliability**: Edge failures could halt vehicles. Explore redundant edge nodes.

### Research Opportunities

- Model multi-vehicle coordination using graph theory for V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) networks.
- Test 6G for sub-1 ms latency in simulations.
- Develop AI inference models (e.g., MobileNet) for edge-based obstacle detection.

## 3. Smart Cities: Traffic Management with IoT and Edge

### Overview

Smart cities like Singapore use IoT cameras and edge nodes with 5G to manage traffic, adjusting signals in <10 ms (Smart City Reports, 2025).

### Implementation

- **IoT Setup**: Cameras at intersections (e.g., 10 per junction) send 2 KB image packets every second via 5G.
- **Edge Computing**: Edge servers at intersections process images to detect congestion and adjust signals.
- **Network**: Star topology (cameras to edge node) for simplicity, with 5G for low latency.

### Scalability Analysis

- **Challenge**: A city with 1,000 intersections, each with 10 cameras, totals 10,000 devices.
- **Model**: Load = Cameras × Data Rate. For 10 cameras, 16,000 bits/s: Load = 10 × 16,000 / 1e6 = 0.16 Mbps per intersection. City-wide: 1,000 × 0.16 = 160 Mbps.
- **Solution**: Scale horizontally with edge servers per intersection.

### Latency Analysis

- **Edge Advantage**: Edge at 0.5 km yields latency ~0.06 ms (Propagation: 0.5/200 = 0.0025 ms, Transmission: 16,000/1e9 × 1,000 = 0.016 ms, Queue: 0.03 ms, Processing: 0.01 ms).
- **Cloud Comparison**: Cloud at 200 km yields ~1.06 ms (Propagation: 200/200 = 1 ms).
- **Impact**: Edge ensures sub-10 ms for real-time traffic control.

### Challenges

- **Scalability**: Managing thousands of cameras requires robust middleware. Solution: Use MQTT for efficient messaging.
- **Security**: Cameras are hackable. Research secure 5G protocols.
- **Cost**: Edge servers are expensive. Optimize placement with AI.

### Research Opportunities

- Simulate city-scale networks in OMNeT++ to test scalability.
- Explore blockchain for secure traffic data sharing.
- Model 6G for ultra-low latency in future smart cities.
