## 1. Introduction to IoT and Edge Computing

Let’s start with the basics, like building a house from the foundation. This section explains IoT and edge computing as if to a friend, ensuring you grasp every concept.

### 1.1 What is IoT? History and Evolution

**Internet of Things (IoT)** means connecting everyday objects—like your fridge, car, or watch—to the internet so they can send and receive information, like friends chatting. These objects have sensors to measure things (e.g., temperature) and actuators to do actions (e.g., turn on a light).

**History**:

- **1982**: First IoT device—a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University checked drink status online.
- **1999**: Kevin Ashton coined “IoT” while working on RFID tags (small chips that send signals without batteries).
- **2025**: Over 75 billion devices connected globally, per Statista reports, driven by cheaper sensors and faster networks like 5G.

**Analogy**: IoT is like a giant school where every student (device) shares notes (data) through a teacher (network). The more students, the harder it is to manage—hinting at scalability challenges.

**Evolution**:

- Early: RFID for tracking goods (e.g., Walmart in 2005).
- Now: Smart homes, cities, and AI-powered devices.

### 1.2 What is Edge Computing? Role and Evolution

**Edge Computing** means doing computer work near the device, not in far-away cloud servers (big online computers). It’s like cooking dinner at home instead of ordering from a restaurant 100 miles away—faster and less hassle.

**History**:

- **1990s**: Started with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) by Akamai, storing website data closer to users.
- **2010s**: Grew with mobile phones and IoT. By 2025, 75% of data is processed at the edge, per IDC.
- **Role**: Cuts wait time (latency) and saves internet bandwidth by processing locally.

**Analogy**: Edge is like a local librarian who answers your question immediately, while the cloud is a distant library with more books but takes longer to reach.

**Example**: A smart camera processes motion detection locally, only sending alerts to the cloud, saving data.

### 1.3 Computer Networks: The Backbone of IoT and Edge

Networks are the roads for data to travel. IoT and edge rely on:

- **Wired**: Ethernet for stable connections (e.g., in factories).
- **Wireless**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee (low-power mesh), 5G (fast mobile).
- **Protocols**: Rules for talking.
  - **MQTT**: Lightweight, like quick texts (publish/subscribe model).
  - **CoAP**: For low-power devices.
  - **IPv6**: Gives unique addresses to billions of devices.
  - **Zigbee**: Mesh for smart homes (e.g., Philips Hue lights).

**Topologies** (connection shapes):

- **Star**: Devices connect to one hub (simple but less robust).
- **Mesh**: Devices connect to each other (strong but complex).
- **Hybrid**: Mix for balance.

**Analogy**: Networks are like a city’s roads—devices are houses, data are cars, and protocols are traffic rules.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

Now, let’s dive into the science, like Einstein explaining gravity. We’ll use clear math with step-by-step explanations.

### 2.1 IoT Architecture and Components

IoT systems have five layers, like floors in a building:

1. **Perception Layer**: Sensors (e.g., temperature) and actuators (e.g., motors) collect data or act.
2. **Network Layer**: Sends data via Wi-Fi, 5G, or Zigbee.
3. **Middleware Layer**: Organizes data from different devices, ensuring they work together.
4. **Application Layer**: Shows results (e.g., phone app showing room temperature).
5. **Business Layer**: Handles money, privacy, and ethics.

**Components**:

- **Sensors**: Measure environment (e.g., soil moisture sensor).
- **Actuators**: Perform actions (e.g., sprinkler valve).
- **Microcontrollers**: Tiny computers (e.g., Arduino).
- **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi chips, 5G modems.

**Math**: Device density: \( \rho = \frac{N}{A} \), where \( N \) = number of devices, \( A \) = area.

- _Example_: 100 sensors in 10 m² plot: \( \rho = 100 / 10 = 10 \) devices/m². High density causes interference, a scalability issue.

### 2.2 Edge Computing Architecture

Edge computing decentralizes processing:

- **Edge Nodes**: Smart devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi) or local servers.
- **Fog Computing**: Middle layer between edge and cloud, named by Cisco.
- **MEC (Multi-Access Edge Computing)**: Edge for 5G networks.

**Comparison**:
| Type | Location | Latency | Scalability |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Cloud | Far away | High (50-200 ms) | Vertical (bigger servers) |
| Edge | Near device | Low (<10 ms) | Horizontal (more nodes) |
| Fog | In between | Medium (10-50 ms) | Hybrid |

**Analogy**: Edge is a local shop, cloud is a distant warehouse, fog is a nearby store.

### 2.3 Scalability Models: Vertical, Horizontal, and Hybrid

**Scalability**: Handling more devices/data without slowing down.

- **Vertical Scalability**: Add power to one machine (e.g., bigger server). Limited by cost and physics.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Add more machines (e.g., more edge nodes). Better for IoT.
- **Hybrid**: Combine both for flexibility.

**Math Model**: Exponential device growth:
\[ D(t) = D_0 \times 2^t \]

- _Example_: \( D_0 = 100 \), \( t = 4 \): \( D(4) = 100 \times 2^4 = 100 \times 16 = 1600 \) devices.

**Amdahl’s Law**: Limits speedup with more processors:
\[ S = \frac{1}{(1-p) + \frac{p}{n}} \]

- \( p \): Parallel portion (e.g., 0.9 for 90% parallel tasks).
- \( n \): Number of processors.
- _Calculation_:
  - \( p = 0.9 \), \( n = 4 \).
  - Serial: \( 1-p = 0.1 \).
  - Parallel: \( p/n = 0.9/4 = 0.225 \).
  - Total: \( 0.1 + 0.225 = 0.325 \).
  - Speedup: \( S = 1 / 0.325 \approx 3.077 \).

**Network Load**: \( Load = Devices \times Data Rate \).

- _Example_: 1,000 devices, 500 bits/s: \( Load = 1,000 \times 500 / 10^6 = 0.5 \) Mbps.

### 2.4 Latency Models: Components and Analysis

**Latency**: Time delay for data to travel and be processed.

**Components**:

- **Propagation Delay**: \( D_p = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \), speed ~200 km/ms in fiber.
- **Transmission Delay**: \( D_t = \frac{\text{Packet Size}}{\text{Bandwidth}} \times 1000 \) (ms).
- **Queuing Delay**: \( D_q \), wait in line at nodes.
- **Processing Delay**: \( D\_{proc} \), computation time.

**Total Latency**:
\[ L = D*p + D_t + D_q + D*{proc} \]

**Example Calculation**:

- Distance = 100 km, Packet = 10 KB (80,000 bits), Bandwidth = 100 Mbps, \( D*q = 0.2 \) ms, \( D*{proc} = 0.1 \) ms.
- \( D_p = 100 / 200 = 0.5 \) ms.
- \( D_t = 80,000 / 100,000,000 \times 1000 = 0.8 \) ms.
- \( L = 0.5 + 0.8 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.6 \) ms.

### 2.5 Queuing Theory and Network Calculus

**M/M/1 Queue**: Models random arrivals (\( \lambda \)) and service (\( \mu \)).

- **Queuing Delay**: \( D_q = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \cdot \frac{1}{\mu} \), where \( \rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \).
- _Example_:
  - \( \lambda = 5/s \), \( \mu = 10/s \).
  - \( \rho = 5/10 = 0.5 \).
  - \( L_q = 0.5 / (1-0.5) = 1 \).
  - \( D_q = 1 / 10 = 0.1 \) s.

**Network Calculus**: Provides deterministic latency bounds.

- Arrival Curve: \( A(t) = r \cdot t + b \), where \( r \) = rate, \( b \) = burst.
- Service Curve: Guarantees minimum processing rate.
- _Use Case_: Ensures worst-case latency for real-time IoT.
