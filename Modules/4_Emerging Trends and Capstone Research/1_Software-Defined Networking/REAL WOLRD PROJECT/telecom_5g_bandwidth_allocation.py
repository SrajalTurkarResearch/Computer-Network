# telecom_5g_bandwidth_allocation.py
# Models SDN-based bandwidth allocation for a 5G network, ensuring fair resource distribution.
# Purpose: Show how SDN optimizes telecom networks, inspired by AT&T's 5G deployment.
# Requirements: Install PuLP (`pip install pulp`).
# Usage: Run directly (`python telecom_5g_bandwidth_allocation.py`) to compute bandwidth allocation.

import pulp

# Define the bandwidth allocation problem
prob = pulp.LpProblem("5G_Bandwidth_Allocation", pulp.LpMaximize)

# Variables: Bandwidth for three users (A, B, C)
A = pulp.LpVariable("A", 0, 50)  # Max 50 Mbps per user
B = pulp.LpVariable("B", 0, 50)
C = pulp.LpVariable("C", 0, 50)

# Objective: Maximize total bandwidth
prob += A + B + C

# Constraint: Total link capacity is 100 Mbps
prob += A + B + C <= 100

# Solve
prob.solve()
print(f"User A: {pulp.value(A):.2f} Mbps")
print(f"User B: {pulp.value(B):.2f} Mbps")
print(f"User C: {pulp.value(C):.2f} Mbps")
print(f"Total bandwidth: {pulp.value(A + B + C):.2f} Mbps")

# Notes for scientists:
# - Real-world impact: AT&T used SDN to deploy 5G services in days, not months.
# - Research idea: Add dynamic constraints for real-time 5G traffic (e.g., concerts).
# - Try in Mininet: Simulate a 5G-like topology with Ryu to prioritize user traffic.
