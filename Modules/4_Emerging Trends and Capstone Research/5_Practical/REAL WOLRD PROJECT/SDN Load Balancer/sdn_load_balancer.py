# sdn_load_balancer.py
# Purpose: Implement a simple SDN load balancer using Mininet and Ryu. The topology
# includes 3 hosts and 2 switches, with the Ryu controller distributing traffic
# across two paths to balance load. This demonstrates SDN's centralized control
# for optimizing network performance, as seen in real-world cases like Google's B4.
# Usage: Run with `sudo python3 sdn_load_balancer.py` in a Ubuntu environment with
# Mininet and Ryu installed (`sudo apt install mininet`, `pip3 install ryu`).
# In a separate terminal, start Ryu with the custom controller:
# `ryu-manager load_balancer_controller.py`.
# Test with Mininet CLI: `h1 iperf -c h3 -t 10` to measure throughput.
# Learning Objective: Understand how SDN controllers program flow rules to balance
# traffic, a key feature for next-generation networks.

# Notes for Aspiring Scientist:
# - This topology allows the Ryu controller to distribute traffic from h1 to h3
#   via two paths (s1-s2 or s1-h2-s2), mimicking load balancing in real SDN networks.
# - Experiment: Use `iperf` to measure throughput (`h1 iperf -c h3 -t 10`).
#   Compare with and without load balancing.
# - Research Idea: Hypothesize that load balancing reduces latency by 20%.
#   Measure with `ping -c 10 h1 h3` and analyze variance.
# - Real-World Connection: Googleâ€™s B4 uses SDN to achieve 70% link utilization
#   by balancing traffic dynamically.
