## Chapter 1: Introduction to Network Security

### 1.1 What is Network Security?

Network security protects data as it travels across interconnected systems, from simple home Wi-Fi to global cloud infrastructures. In 2025, with over 30 billion connected devices (IoT growth), security is paramount to prevent breaches costing trillions annually.

- **Core Goal** : Ensure data reaches the intended recipient safely, without interception, alteration, or denial.
- **Analogy** : Sending a valuable package through a crowded city—use locks (encryption), seals (integrity checks), and guards (authentication) to protect it.
- **Historical Context** : Evolved from 1970s ARPANET to modern zero-trust models, driven by threats like the 1988 Morris Worm and 2020 SolarWinds attack.

### 1.2 The Expanded CIA+ Triad

The **CIA+ triad** is the foundation:

- **Confidentiality** : Data privacy (e.g., encryption hides content).
- **Integrity** : Data unchanged (e.g., hashes detect tampering).
- **Availability** : Data accessible (e.g., anti-DoS measures).
- **+ Extensions (2025 Focus)** :
- **Non-repudiation** : Proof of actions (e.g., digital signatures).
- **Authorization** : Permissions after authentication.
- **Accountability** : Logging for audits.
- **Resilience** : Recovering from attacks (e.g., AI-driven recovery).

### 1.3 Common Threats and Attacks (Updated for 2025)

- **Eavesdropping** : Packet sniffing on unsecured Wi-Fi.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** : Intercepting via rogue hotspots.
- **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)** : Flooding with botnets (e.g., 2024's 2.5 Tbps attacks).
- **Impersonation/Spoofing** : Faking IPs or certificates.
- **Tampering** : Altering data in transit.
- **Replay Attacks** : Reusing captured packets.
- **Emerging Threats** : Quantum attacks (breaking RSA), AI-generated phishing, 5G vulnerabilities.

### 1.4 Why Protocols Matter

Protocols implement security principles using cryptography. In 2025, with quantum computing advancing, protocols emphasize post-quantum algorithms.

- **Cryptography Basics** :
- **Symmetric** : Same key for encrypt/decrypt (e.g., AES-256).
- **Asymmetric** : Public/private keys (e.g., RSA).
- **Hashing** : One-way fingerprints (e.g., SHA-256).

### 1.5 Overview of Covered Protocols

- **TLS/SSL** : Web security.
- **IPsec** : Network traffic protection.
- **VPNs** : Secure remote access.
- **Formal Models** : Proof-based security.

Visualize the OSI Model: TLS at Transport/Application, IPsec at Network, VPNs span multiple layers.

## Chapter 2: TLS/SSL: Securing Application Communication

### 2.1 Overview and History

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)** evolved from **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** , created by Netscape in 1994. As of 2025, TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446, 2018) is the standard, with no major new version but ongoing enhancements like shorter certificate validity (down to 90 days or less to reduce risks).

- **Deprecations** : TLS 1.0/1.1 fully retired by 2025; all major browsers enforce TLS 1.2+.
- **Adoption** : Over 90% of websites use TLS 1.3, driven by quantum threats.
- **Analogy** : TLS is a secure envelope for your digital letters, with ID verification.

### 2.2 Detailed Mechanics

TLS secures connections via:

1. **Handshake** (Expanded Steps):
   - Client Hello: Versions, ciphers (e.g., AES-256-GCM), nonce.
   - Server Hello: Selected cipher, nonce, certificate (issued by CA like Let's Encrypt).
   - Certificate Verification: Client checks chain of trust.
   - Key Exchange: ECDHE for forward secrecy (prevents past session decryption).
   - Finished: HMAC verifies no tampering.

- **Data Transfer** : Symmetric encryption + MAC.
- **Termination** : Close_notify to prevent truncation attacks.
- **Limitations Missed in Prior Tutorials** : TLS doesn't protect against all MitM (e.g., if CA is compromised); vulnerable to implementation bugs.

### 2.3 Cryptographic Algorithms (With 2025 Updates)

- **Asymmetric** : RSA (deprecated for key exchange in TLS 1.3), ECDH (preferred), post-quantum like Kyber (experimental in 2025).
- **Symmetric** : AES-256-GCM (fast, authenticated), ChaCha20-Poly1305 (mobile-friendly).
- **Hashing** : SHA-384+ (SHA-256 still common but phasing for quantum resistance).

### 2.4 Mathematical Foundations (Step-by-Step)

- **RSA** :
- Key Gen: Primes ( p=3, q=11 ), ( n=33 ), ( \phi(n)=20 ), ( e=7 ), ( d=3 ).
- Encrypt ( m=5 ): ( 5^7 \mod 33 = 14 ).
- Decrypt: ( 14^3 \mod 33 = 5 ).
- **Diffie-Hellman** (Full Calc): As in tutorial, expanded with logs for discrete logarithm hardness.
- **Elliptic Curves** : ( y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \mod p ); scalar multiplication for keys.

### 2.5 Real-World Examples and Visualizations

- **HTTPS** : Encrypts shopping on Amazon.
- **2025 Trend** : Automated certificate management (ACM) mandatory due to 90-day limits.
- **Visualization** (Text Description): Flowchart of handshake arrows between client/server.

### 2.6 Limitations and Ethical Considerations

- **Weaknesses** : Certificate pinning bypasses, quantum vulnerabilities.
- **Ethics** : TLS enables privacy but can hide malicious traffic.
