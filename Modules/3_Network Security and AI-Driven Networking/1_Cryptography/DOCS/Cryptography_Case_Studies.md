# Case Studies in Cryptography for Computer Networks

This document presents four detailed case studies illustrating the application of symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange in real-world computer network scenarios. Each case study includes an overview, technical details, challenges, lessons learned, and research implications, designed to deepen your understanding as an aspiring scientist and inspire future investigations.

## Case Study 1: HTTPS and TLS for Secure Web Browsing

### Overview

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) powers secure web communication, ensuring that your interactions with websites (e.g., online shopping, banking) are private and authentic. It uses a hybrid cryptographic approach: asymmetric encryption (RSA or Diffie-Hellman) for secure key exchange and symmetric encryption (AES) for efficient data transfer.

### Technical Details

- **TLS Handshake** :

1. The client (your browser) connects to a server (e.g., amazon.com).
2. The server sends a digital certificate containing its public key (RSA or ECC) or Diffie-Hellman parameters.
3. The client verifies the certificate using a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
4. The client generates a random session key (for AES) and encrypts it with the server’s public key or uses Diffie-Hellman to compute a shared key.
5. Both parties use the session key for AES encryption of data (e.g., your credit card details).

- **Algorithms** : RSA/ECC for key exchange, AES-256 for data encryption, SHA-256 for integrity checks.
- **Example** : When you buy something on Amazon, your browser and Amazon’s server agree on an AES key via Diffie-Hellman, then encrypt your payment details with AES.

### Challenges

- **Performance** : Asymmetric encryption is computationally intensive, so TLS uses it only for key exchange.
- **Certificate Management** : Ensuring certificates are valid and not revoked is complex.
- **Quantum Threat** : RSA and ECC may be vulnerable to quantum computers by 2030.

### Lessons Learned

- Hybrid cryptography combines the speed of symmetric encryption with the security of asymmetric encryption.
- Certificates are critical for authentication, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Forward secrecy (using Diffie-Hellman) ensures past sessions remain secure if keys are compromised.

### Research Implications

- Investigate post-quantum algorithms (e.g., Kyber) for TLS to counter quantum threats.
- Explore AI-driven certificate validation to detect fraudulent certificates.
- Optimize hybrid protocols for low-power devices like IoT sensors.

## Case Study 2: WhatsApp’s End-to-End Encryption with the Signal Protocol

### Overview

WhatsApp uses the Signal Protocol to provide end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the sender and receiver can read messages, even if intercepted by WhatsApp’s servers or hackers.

### Technical Details

- **Signal Protocol** :

1. **Key Exchange** : Uses Diffie-Hellman (specifically, Curve25519-based ECDH) to establish a shared secret key for each chat session.
2. **Symmetric Encryption** : The shared key is used with AES-256 in GCM mode to encrypt messages.
3. **Forward Secrecy** : Each message or session uses a new key derived via a ratchet mechanism, ensuring that a compromised key doesn’t expose past messages.
4. **Authentication** : Uses digital signatures (via ECC) to verify user identities.

- **Example** : When you send “Meet me at 6 PM” to a friend, Diffie-Hellman creates a unique key, AES encrypts the message, and only your friend’s device can decrypt it.

### Challenges

- **Key Management** : Managing keys for billions of users across devices is complex.
- **Usability** : Ensuring encryption is seamless for non-technical users.
- **Metadata** : While messages are encrypted, metadata (e.g., who you’re messaging) may still be collected.

### Lessons Learned

- Forward secrecy is a powerful technique for privacy, especially in messaging.
- ECC provides efficient, secure key exchange for mobile devices.
- User trust relies on transparent, verifiable encryption protocols.

### Research Implications

- Develop lightweight key exchange protocols for resource-constrained devices.
- Investigate privacy-preserving metadata protection techniques.
- Explore zero-knowledge proofs for anonymous messaging authentication.

## Case Study 3: Bitcoin’s Use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography

### Overview

Bitcoin relies on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to secure wallet addresses and transaction signatures, ensuring that only the owner of a Bitcoin wallet can spend their funds.

### Technical Details

- **ECC in Bitcoin** :

1. **Key Generation** : Each Bitcoin wallet has a private-public key pair based on the secp256k1 elliptic curve.
2. **Signatures** : The private key signs transactions (using ECDSA), proving ownership without revealing the key.
3. **Verification** : The public key verifies the signature, ensuring the transaction is legitimate.
4. **Address Creation** : The public key is hashed (SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160) to create a Bitcoin address.

- **Example** : When you send 0.1 BTC, your private key signs the transaction, and nodes on the Bitcoin network verify it using your public key.

### Challenges

- **Key Security** : Losing a private key means losing access to your Bitcoin.
- **Scalability** : ECC operations can be slow for large-scale blockchain networks.
- **Quantum Vulnerability** : Quantum computers could potentially break ECC.

### Lessons Learned

- ECC’s small key sizes enable efficient cryptography for decentralized systems.
- Digital signatures are critical for trust in trustless networks.
- Key management is a major user responsibility in cryptocurrencies.

### Research Implications

- Explore quantum-resistant signature schemes for blockchain.
- Investigate multi-signature protocols for enhanced wallet security.
- Develop hardware-based key storage solutions for user convenience.

## Case Study 4: Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration in 2025

### Overview

With quantum computing advancing, organizations are transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to protect against future quantum attacks that could break RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman.

### Technical Details

- **PQC Algorithms** :

1. **Lattice-Based Cryptography** : Algorithms like Kyber and Dilithium are resistant to quantum attacks (e.g., Shor’s algorithm).
2. **Key Exchange** : Kyber replaces Diffie-Hellman in protocols like TLS.
3. **Signatures** : Dilithium provides quantum-resistant digital signatures.

- **Migration Process** :

1. Update protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3) to support PQC algorithms.
2. Maintain compatibility with legacy systems during transition.
3. Test interoperability across networks.

- **Example** : In 2025, a company updates its VPN to use Kyber for key exchange, ensuring quantum-resistant security.

### Challenges

- **Performance** : PQC algorithms often require larger keys or more computation.
- **Compatibility** : Legacy systems may not support new algorithms.
- **Standardization** : Ongoing NIST efforts to finalize PQC standards.

### Lessons Learned

- Proactive migration is critical to stay ahead of quantum threats.
- Hybrid protocols (combining classical and PQC algorithms) ease transition.
- Interoperability testing is essential for global adoption.

### Research Implications

- Optimize PQC algorithms for speed and efficiency.
- Develop hybrid cryptographic protocols for seamless migration.
- Investigate quantum key distribution (QKD) for ultra-secure networks.
