**Author's Note** : Inspired by pioneers like Alan Turing and Claude Shannon, this guide emphasizes logical reasoning, experimentation, and curiosity. Structure your notes chapter by chapter for easy reference.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Cryptography

### 1.1 What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the art and science of protecting information by transforming readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) that only authorized parties can access. In computer networks, it safeguards data traveling over insecure channels like the internet.

- **Historical Evolution** :
- Ancient: Substitution ciphers (e.g., Caesar shift: A → D).
- Medieval: Frequency analysis to break ciphers.
- WWII: Enigma machine (symmetric, rotor-based) cracked by Turing's Bombe.
- 1970s: Public-key cryptography (asymmetric) by Diffie, Hellman, Rivest, Shamir, Adleman.
- 2025: Post-quantum focus due to quantum computers (e.g., Google's quantum supremacy milestones).

### 1.2 Why Cryptography in Networks?

Networks transmit data packets that can be intercepted (e.g., via packet sniffers). Cryptography ensures:

- **Confidentiality** : Eavesdroppers can't read data.
- **Integrity** : Data isn't modified (e.g., via hash checks).
- **Authentication** : Proves identities (e.g., digital signatures).
- **Non-repudiation** : Senders can't deny actions.

  **Analogy** : Imagine mailing a letter in a public mailbox. Without cryptography, it's an open postcard; with it, it's a locked safe only the recipient can open.

### 1.3 Core Principles

- **Encryption/Decryption** : Forward/reverse transformations.
- **Keys** : Secrets controlling the process.
- **Algorithms** : Mathematical rules (e.g., AES, RSA).
- **Security Models** : Assume attackers know the algorithm (Kerckhoffs's principle); security relies on key secrecy.

### 1.4 Ethical Considerations

- Cryptography enables privacy but can aid illegal activities. As a scientist, balance innovation with societal impact (e.g., backdoors debate in 2020s).

## Chapter 2: Symmetric Encryption

### 2.1 Fundamentals

Uses one key for both encryption and decryption. Ideal for fast, bulk data processing.

- **Process** :

1. Sender encrypts plaintext with key → ciphertext.
2. Transmit ciphertext.
3. Receiver decrypts with same key → plaintext.

**Analogy** : A shared padlock key; both parties need it beforehand.

### 2.2 Key Algorithms

- **AES (Rijndael)** :
- Block size: 128 bits.
- Keys: 128/192/256 bits (10/12/14 rounds).
- Operations: SubBytes (substitution), ShiftRows (permutation), MixColumns (linear transformation), AddRoundKey (XOR with key).
- **DES** : 64-bit blocks, 56-bit key, 16 rounds (outdated; broken by brute-force in 1990s).
- **3DES** : Triple DES for backward compatibility.
- **Blowfish/Twofish** : Variable keys, fast alternatives.
- **ChaCha20** : Stream cipher for mobile/IoT (faster than AES on some hardware).

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundations

- **Block Cipher Structure** : Feistel network (DES) or SPN (AES).
- **AES Round** (simplified):
  - State: 4x4 byte matrix.
  - SubBytes: Replace each byte via S-box (non-linear).
  - ShiftRows: Cyclic shifts.
  - MixColumns: Matrix multiplication over GF(2^8).
  - AddRoundKey: XOR with expanded key.
- **Key Expansion** : From main key, derive round keys (e.g., AES-128: 11 keys).
- **Formulas** :
- Encryption: ( C = E(P, K) )
- Decryption: ( P = D(C, K) )
- **Security** : Resists differential/linear cryptanalysis.

### 2.4 Modes of Operation

- **ECB** : Independent blocks (insecure for patterns).
- **CBC** : Chains blocks with IV (initialization vector).
- **GCM** : Authenticated encryption (integrity + confidentiality).
- **Pitfall** : Reuse IV in CTR mode leaks data.

### 2.5 Real-World Examples

- Wi-Fi (WPA3): AES for traffic.
- File Encryption: VeraCrypt uses AES.

### 2.6 Advantages/Limitations

- **Adv** : Speed (hardware-accelerated).
- **Lim** : Key distribution (solved by DH).

### 2.7 Visualizations

Imagine a flowchart:

```
Plaintext → [AES + Key] → Ciphertext → Network → [AES + Key] → Plaintext
```

## Chapter 3: Asymmetric Encryption

### 3.1 Fundamentals

Uses key pairs: public (encrypt/verify) and private (decrypt/sign).

- **Process** :

1. Receiver shares public key.
2. Sender encrypts with public → ciphertext.
3. Receiver decrypts with private.

**Analogy** : A public mailbox (anyone drops letters) but private key opens it.

### 3.2 Key Algorithms

- **RSA** :
- Key sizes: 2048+ bits (2025 standard).
- Based on factoring large composites.
- **ECC** :
- Curves: secp256r1, Curve25519.
- Point multiplication: Scalar × Generator = Public key.
- **ElGamal** : Discrete log-based.

### 3.3 Mathematical Foundations

- **RSA** :
- Primes ( p, q ); ( n = p q ); ( \phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) ).
- ( e ) coprime to ( \phi(n) ); ( d = e^{-1} \mod \phi(n) ).
- Encrypt: ( c = m^e \mod n ).
- Decrypt: ( m = c^d \mod n ).
- Proof: Euler's theorem ( m^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n ).
- **ECC** :
- Curve: ( y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \mod p ).
- Public: ( Q = d G ) (private ( d ), generator ( G )).
- Security: ECDLP (hard to find ( d ) from ( Q, G )).

### 3.4 Padding Schemes

- OAEP: Prevents malleability attacks.
- PKCS#1: Legacy, vulnerable to Bleichenbacher attack.

### 3.5 Real-World Examples

- SSH: RSA for authentication.
- PGP Email: RSA/ECC for keys.

### 3.6 Advantages/Limitations

- **Adv** : No shared secret needed.
- **Lim** : Slower; vulnerable to quantum (Shor's algorithm).

### 3.7 Visualizations

Flowchart:

```
Sender → Receiver's Public Key → Ciphertext → Network → Receiver's Private Key → Plaintext
```

## Chapter 4: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

### 4.1 Fundamentals

Enables shared secret over public channels.

- **Process** :

1. Agree on ( p, g ).
2. Private ( a, b ); public ( A = g^a \mod p ), ( B = g^b \mod p ).
3. Shared ( s = B^a = A^b \mod p ).

**Analogy** : Mix colors publicly but keep ratios secret.

### 4.2 Mathematical Foundations

- Discrete Log Problem: Hard to find ( a ) from ( g^a \mod p ).
- Variants: ECDH (using ECC for smaller keys).

### 4.3 Parameters

- Safe primes (Sophie Germain).
- 2025: 3072-bit moduli.

### 4.4 Real-World Examples

- IPSec VPNs.
- Signal Protocol.

### 4.5 Advantages/Limitations

- **Adv** : Perfect forward secrecy.
- **Lim** : No authentication (add signatures).

### 4.6 Visualizations

```
Alice: g^a mod p → Bob
Bob: g^b mod p → Alice
Both: (received)^private mod p = shared
```
