## Case Study 1: Protocol Misuse in Mobile Networks (2025)

**Vulnerabilities in 2G to 5G Protocols**

**Background:**  
Mobile networks use protocols such as GSM (2G), UMTS (3G), LTE (4G), and NR (5G) to enable secure communication. Implementation flaws can lead to misuse, e.g., fake base stations (IMSI catchers) intercepting mobile data.

**Key Events:**  
In 2025, researchers at P1 Security reported widespread protocol misuse, including SS7 signaling attacks in 3G/4G and slicing vulnerabilities in 5G. Attackers exploited the Diameter protocol in 4G to reroute traffic, impacting millions in Europe.

**Technical Analysis:**  
Protocols like IPsec in 5G tunnels were sometimes misconfigured, exposing networks to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

> _Example:_ In Diffie-Hellman key exchange (used by IPsec), using weak primes made the system vulnerable to factorization in _O(2<sup>64</sup>)_ time on quantum-assisted hardware.

**Lessons Learned:**

- Regular security audits
- Formal verification (e.g., Tamarin prover)
- Upgrade to TLS 1.3-level security in mobile stacks

**Research Implications:**

- Explore AI-augmented protocol fuzzing for proactive vulnerability detection
- Investigate integration of quantum-resistant protocols (like Kyber) in 6G networks

## Case Study 2: Equifax Data Breach (2025 Analysis)

**Secure Protocol Failures in Legacy Systems**

**Background:**  
Although the Equifax breach happened in 2017, analyses in 2025 highlight persistent issues like the use of outdated SSLv3 in legacy systems.

**Key Events:**  
Attackers exploited an Apache Struts vulnerability, and weak TLS enabled exfiltration of data affecting 147 million records. In 2025, similar misconfigurations are still seen, especially in IoT deployments.

**Technical Analysis:**  
Failure to enforce HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) allowed downgrade attacks.

> _Cryptography Note:_ Deprecated RC4 in TLS enabled decrypted data interception.

**Lessons Learned:**

- Require certificate pinning
- Enforce zero-trust architectures
- Migrate legacy systems to post-quantum cryptography (per NIST guidelines)

**Research Implications:**

- Create models for protocol evolution and simulate attacks with tools like Scapy

## Case Study 3: Enterprise Wi-Fi Security Evolution (2025)

**WPA3 Implementation and Real-World Challenges**

**Background:**  
Wi-Fi security has evolved from WEP to WPA3, but deployments often lag behind standards.

**Key Events:**  
In 2025, LinkedIn reports showed companies like Cisco adopting WPA3 with SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals), which reduced KRACK-like attacks by 80% in test environments.

**Technical Analysis:**  
SAE uses the Dragonfly handshake, robust against offline dictionary attacks.

> _Math:_ Security rests on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. Forward secrecy is ensured by ephemeral keys.

**Lessons Learned:**

- Training staff is crucial to correct configuration
- Mixed WPA2/WPA3 environments created vulnerabilities (e.g., in a 2025 hospital breach)

**Research Implications:**

- Apply AI for dynamic protocol selection in complex, heterogeneous networks

## Case Study 4: AI-Driven Network Optimization at AT&T (2025)

**Background:**  
Telecom leaders are deploying AI for adaptive network management in 5G/6G.

**Key Events:**  
AT&T's system predicted hardware failures and reduced downtime by 40%. Using ML-based beamforming optimization, it efficiently allocated bandwidth during major events (e.g., Super Bowl 2025).

**Technical Analysis:**

- LSTM models predicted network traffic
- Reinforcement learning adjusted network routing
  > _Q-Learning formula:_  
  > Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + α [r + γ max Q(s', a') – Q(s, a)]

**Lessons Learned:**

- Data quality is essential; biased training led to resource misallocation in rural areas

**Research Implications:**

- Extend AI to the edge for real-time IoT swarm optimization

**Background:**  
Huawei adopted AI-driven large models for automated wireless optimization.

**Key Events:**  
TM Forum's 2025 project reported that Huawei’s systems reduced energy use by 20% in Chinese telecom networks by integrating AI with smart hardware.

**Technical Analysis:**

- Genetic algorithms for antenna tilt optimization
- Big data analytics for congestion prediction

**Lessons Learned:**

- Scalability remains challenging in multi-vendor environments

**Research Implications:**

- Advance federated learning for privacy-preserving, cross-provider optimization
