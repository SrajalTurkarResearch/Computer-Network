    "## 1. Introduction to Quantum Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Quantum Networking?**  \n",
    "Quantum networking uses quantum mechanics to create computer networks that transmit data using *quantum bits* (qubits) instead of classical bits (0s or 1s). Qubits leverage *superposition* (being 0 and 1 simultaneously) and *entanglement* (linked particles that act as one across distances) to enable secure communication and distributed quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It Matters**: Classical networks (e.g., the internet) face challenges: signal loss over distance and vulnerability to hacking (e.g., RSA encryption breakable by quantum computers). Quantum networks offer:\n",
    "- **Unhackable security** via quantum key distribution (QKD).  \n",
    "- **Instant correlations** via entanglement for applications like distributed computing.  \n",
    "- **Future-proofing** for a quantum internet by 2035–2040.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Relatable Story**: Classical networks are like mailing letters—anyone can open them if they crack the lock. Quantum networks are like magic boxes: if a spy peeks, the message self-destructs, and you’re alerted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Context (2025)**: IonQ’s September 2025 breakthrough converted quantum photons to telecom wavelengths, enabling integration with existing fiber networks. DARPA’s QuANET achieved 6.8 Mbps in a hybrid quantum-classical network in August 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Math Insight**: Classical bit capacity is 1 bit (0 or 1). Quantum capacity (Holevo bound) is higher: for a qubit, up to 1 bit, but multi-qubit systems can encode more via entanglement. Simple probability: $P(0) + P(1) = 1$. Example: Equal superposition qubit, $P(0) = 0.5$, $P(1) = 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization Idea**: Sketch a globe with glowing quantum links between cities (entanglement) vs. solid lines (classical). Add a timeline: 1969 (ARPANET) to 2035 (quantum internet).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Your Research**: Quantum networking is your gateway to inventing secure global systems or quantum cloud platforms."

    "\n",
    "To appreciate quantum networking, let’s master classical networks first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Bits, Packets, and OSI Layers\n",
    "**What**: Bits (0 or 1) are sent as electrical or light signals. Packets group bits. The OSI model has 7 layers (physical to application) handling tasks from cables to apps.\n",
    "**Why**: Signals weaken over distance (attenuation), and noise causes errors, limiting speed.\n",
    "**Story**: Bits are cars on a highway; routers are traffic lights guiding them.\n",
    "**Example**: Wi-Fi sends bits from router to phone.\n",
    "**Math**: Shannon’s capacity: $B = W \\log_2(1 + \\frac{S}{N})$.\n",
    "- $W$: Bandwidth (e.g., 1 MHz = $10^6$ Hz).  \n",
    "- $S/N$: Signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., 3).  \n",
    "- Step 1: $S/N + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4$.  \n",
    "- Step 2: $\\log_2(4) = 2$ (since $2^2 = 4$).  \n",
    "- Step 3: $B = 10^6 \\times 2 = 2 \\times 10^6$ bits/s (2 Mbps).\n",
    "**Real-World**: 5G reaches 10 Gbps, but quantum computers threaten encryption.\n",
    "**Picture**: Draw: Computer → Router → Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Network Topologies and Protocols\n",
    "**What**: Topologies: Star (central hub), mesh (all connected). Protocols like TCP/IP ensure reliable delivery (TCP checks packets, IP routes).\n",
    "**Why**: Shapes balance speed and reliability.\n",
    "**Story**: Star is a teacher (hub) talking to students. Mesh is friends texting everyone.\n",
    "**Example**: Internet’s ocean cables use mesh-like links.\n",
    "**Math**: Dijkstra’s shortest path: A to C via B, A-B = 2 km, B-C = 3 km, total = 5 km.\n",
    "**Picture**: Sketch star (hub with spokes) vs. mesh (crisscross).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Security Challenges\n",
    "**What**: AES encrypts data; RSA uses hard-to-factor numbers.\n",
    "**Why**: Quantum computers (Shor’s algorithm) could break RSA.\n",
    "**Story**: RSA is a lock with a huge key; quantum computers pick it.\n",
    "**Real-World**: Banks use RSA but plan quantum-safe methods by 2030."

    "**Why**: Prevents copying qubits (no-cloning), key for security.\n",
    "**Story**: Catch a fast bee—see its spot or speed, not both.\n",
    "**Math**: $\\Delta x = 10^{-9}$ m, then $\\Delta p \\geq \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{4 \\cdot 3.14 \\cdot 10^{-9}} \\approx 5 \\times 10^{-26}$ kg·m/s.\n",

    "### 3.3 Quantum Measurement\n",
    "**What**: Measuring picks one state, collapsing others.\n",
    "**Why**: Detects spies in QKD.\n",
