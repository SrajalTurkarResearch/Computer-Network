        "A network connects devices (like computers or phones) to share data, like sending messages or files. Imagine it as a city’s road system: devices are houses, cables or Wi-Fi are roads, and rules (protocols) guide traffic.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Types**:\n",
        "  - **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Small, like a home Wi-Fi (fast, <1ms latency).\n",

        "  - **MAN**: City-wide, like cable networks.\n",
        "  - **PAN**: Personal, like Bluetooth for headphones.\n",
        "- **Components**:\n",
        "  - **Hosts**: Devices like laptops with MAC (hardware ID) and IP (network ID) addresses.\n",
        "  - **Switches**: Connect devices in LAN using MAC tables.\n",
        "  - **Routers**: Link networks using IP routing tables.\n",
        "  - **Protocols**: TCP/IP—TCP ensures reliable delivery, UDP is faster but less strict.\n",
