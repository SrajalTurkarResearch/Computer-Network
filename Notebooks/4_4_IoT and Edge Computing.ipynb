    "## 1. Introduction to IoT and Edge Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the basics, as if we're building a house from the ground up. This section explains IoT and edge computing in simple terms, like explaining to a friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What is IoT? History and Components\n",
    "**Internet of Things (IoT)** means connecting everyday objects (like lights, fridges, or cars) to the internet so they can send and receive information. Think of it as giving objects a voice to talk and listen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**History**: The idea began in 1982 when a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University was connected to the internet to report its status. In 1999, Kevin Ashton coined \"IoT\" while working on RFID tags (small chips that send signals). By 2025, over 75 billion devices are connected, according to Statista.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components**:\n",
    "- **Sensors**: Measure things (e.g., temperature).\n",
    "- **Actuators**: Do actions (e.g., turn on a fan).\n",
    "- **Microcontrollers**: Tiny computers (e.g., Arduino).\n",
    "- **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 5G.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture** (like floors of a building):\n",
    "- **Perception Layer**: Sensors collect data.\n",
    "- **Network Layer**: Sends data (e.g., via MQTT protocol).\n",
    "- **Middleware Layer**: Organizes data from many devices.\n",
    "- **Application Layer**: Shows results (e.g., phone app).\n",
    "- **Business Layer**: Handles money and ethics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A smart thermostat senses room temperature, sends it via Wi-Fi, and an app lets you adjust it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 What is Edge Computing? Evolution and Role\n",
    "**Edge Computing** means doing computer work near the device, not far away in big cloud servers. It’s like cooking dinner in your kitchen instead of ordering from a restaurant miles away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**History**: Started with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) in the 1990s by Akamai. Grew big after 2010 with more phones and IoT. By 2025, 75% of data is processed at the edge (IDC reports).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role**: Reduces wait time (latency) and saves internet bandwidth. Edge nodes (like smart routers) process data locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A security camera detects motion locally, only sending alerts to the cloud, saving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Computer Networks in IoT and Edge\n",
    "Networks are the roads for data. IoT uses:\n",
    "- **Wired**: Ethernet for stable connections.\n",
    "- **Wireless**: Wi-Fi, Zigbee (low-power mesh), 5G.\n",
    "- **Protocols**: MQTT (lightweight), CoAP (for low-power devices), IPv6 (for many addresses).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topologies** (shapes of connections):\n",
    "- Star: All connect to one hub.\n",
    "- Mesh: Devices connect to each other.\n",
    "- Hybrid: Mix for flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Networks are like a city’s roads—devices are houses, data are cars, and protocols are traffic rules."
