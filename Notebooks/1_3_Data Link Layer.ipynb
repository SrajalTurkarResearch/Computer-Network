        "The Data Link Layer (Layer 2 in the OSI model) ensures reliable data transfer between adjacent nodes. Derived from first principles: Layer 1 provides raw bit transmission, but it's unreliable due to noise and shared media. Layer 2 adds structure, error handling, and access control.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key Functions** (derived step by step):\n",
        "  - Framing: Wraps bits into frames with headers/trailers. Derivation: Delimiters prevent run-on streams; bit stuffing avoids false flags.\n",
        "  - Physical Addressing: MAC addresses (48-bit unique IDs).\n",
        "  - Flow Control: Sliding windows to match speeds.\n",
